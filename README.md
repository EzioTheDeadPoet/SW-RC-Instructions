# How to install the Star Wars Republic Commando Fix

## What does it fix ?

- This fix enables the game to run on modern systems, without startup crashes.
- Allows for modern resolutions up to 4K (Ultra Widescreen excluded at least to my knowledge).
- Fixes rendering issues caused by modern hardware.
- Enables an FOV setting.
- Enables you to change the strength of the headshake effect.
- Fixes the multiplayer (on a technical level, it is old so only few people are playing it.)

### Steam Specific Instructions

- If you own the game on steam go to your steams installation location and COPY the `steam.dll` to `...\SteamApps\common\Star Wars Republic Commando` or again wherever the game is installed or steam will refuse to launch the game.
